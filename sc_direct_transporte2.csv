In West Africa, many day-to-day transactions require the payment of bribes. Quantitative evidence on these bribes and their determinants is scarce. This paper sheds light on the level and the frequency of bribe payments in informal coss-border trade. It examines how bribes depend on the trade regime and on market structure. We rely on data from a survey of traders in Benin to estimate the determinants of bribe payments. We exploit variations in the trade regime across Benin’s borders, as well as changes in trade restrictions over time and variations in route availability across space and time. We find that reductions in trade barriers help to lower bribes, but do not eliminate them, with bribes remaining frequent in liberalized trade regimes. These results suggest that collusive corruption – used to circumvent regulations and taxes – coexists with coercive corruption, where officials use their monopoly power to extract transfers from traders.","","Informal trade, Corruption, Trade policy","",""

To achieve this, the study relied on both primary and secondary data. Primary data was collected from direct observation, informal group discussions and semi-structured interviews involving state officials, coastal community groups and other civil society organisations in the west maritime district of Southwest Cameroon. The article reveals a plethora of fisheries-related crimes encompassing corruption (i.e. bribery and abuse of office), document and identity fraud, illegal exploitation of fish maws and endangered marine mammals. Other crimes associated to the fisheries sector included: smuggling of contraband goods, arms smuggling, illegal migration, illegal recruitment and abuse of workers' rights. Through these examples, this research empirically demonstrates the interrelationship of the different criminal practices and their organised and transnational dimension. The study also paints a complex picture of criminality perpetuated by a sophisticated network of both local and foreign industrial fisheries stakeholders. Consequently, addressing illicit activities in the maritime fisheries sector requires cooperation from a wide range of both state and non-state actors in investigating and analysing the nature of fisheries crime practices, the agents involved and their modes of operation. This approach is necessary to gain a better understanding of the problem and enable actors design appropriate and targeted management responses.","","Illegal fishing, Fisheries crime, Transnational organized crime, Security, Cameroon","",""

The findings show that fossil fuel consumption is at the heart of logistics operations; the more fossil fuel and non-green energy resources that are used, the more negative effects on society and environmental sustainability result from this. A lower quality of transport-related infrastructure and logistics services is negatively correlated with fossil fuel usage, carbon emissions, health expenditure, greenhouse gas emissions and political instability of SAARC countries. Conversely, efficient customs procedures and greater information sharing among supply chain partners increase trade opportunities and also improve environmental sustainability in terms of minimum carbon emissions due to the shorter waiting and queue times involved. Further, the application of green energy resources and green practices can mitigate negative effects on social and environmental sustainability due to better logistics operations while improving financial performance in terms of higher GDP per capita, trade openness and greater export opportunities around the globe. As there is very limited research using green practices relationship with macro-level indicators in current literature, this research will assist both practitioners and policymakers to understand the roles of green supply chain and green logistics in enhancing environmental sustainability, social improvement and economic growth for a better future.","","Political stability index, Renewable energy sources, Green logistics management, Environmental and economic sustainability","",""

Results from simulations show that reduction of checkpoints along the roads will increase productivity by 30 percent, while the value of beans in the Port will increase 3 percent and of butter 5 percent. Investing in improving secondary and tertiary roads will increase the productivity by 9 percent and value by 1 percent while investing in improving road infrastructure and checkpoints will raise the productivity by 27 percent and the value by 3 percent. The results suggest that a combination of reducing the checkpoints with the investment in secondary and tertiary roads will increase productivity while at the same time the pollution will be reduced importantly.

In this paper, we explore the interplay between traders and authorities on Congo River - a key transport corridor in one of the world’s poorest and most conflict-ridden countries; DR Congo. We outline a general theoretical framework featuring transport operators who need to pass multiple taxing stations and negotiate over taxes with several authorities on their way to a central market place. We then examine empirically the organization, extent, and factors explaining the level of taxes charged by various authorities across stations, by collecting primary data from boat operators. Most of the de facto taxes charged on Congo River have no explicit support in laws or government regulations and have been characterized as a “fend for yourself”-system of funding. Our study shows that traders have to pass more than 10 stations downstream where about 20 different authorities charge taxes. In line with hold-up theory, we find that the average level of taxation tends to increase downstream closer to Kinshasa, but authorities that were explicitly prohibited from taxing in a recent decree instead extract more payments upstream. Our results illustrate a highly dysfunctional taxing regime that nonetheless is strikingly similar to anecdotal evidence of the situation on the Rhine before 1800.

Legislation in the US and the EU prohibits firms from engaging in corrupt practices in foreign countries and this suggests that foreign-owned firms might be less likely to pay bribes. However, such legislation may be ineffective because foreign firms have to adapt to local market conditions or risk being uncompetitive. Using firm-level data for 41 emerging countries, a probit model estimates the probability that a firm pays bribes. To allow for possible endogeneity this probit analysis is repeated with an instrument to proxy for endogenous foreign ownership. Then, a propensity score matching technique tests for differences in the propensity to pay bribes by domestic and foreign firms. The paper finds no difference in the behavior of foreign-owned and domestic firms with respect to corrupt practices. Results are robust to different levels of foreign ownership and support the view that foreign-owned firms adapt to local practices and are neither more nor less likely to pay bribes than comparable domestic firms. The paper finds that other variables including bureaucracy, government contracts, and perceived difficulties with civil society (legal and political) do have statistically significant effects on increasing bribery and that some others, such as per capita GDP, tend to reduce bribery. The study concludes that there is no evidence that foreign ownership, after investment has occurred, tends to reduce bribery but it does support the view that foreign-owned firms adopt local behavioral norms.","","inward FDI, corruption, emerging markets, propensity score matching","",""

We argue that in a situation whereby formal institutions are weak, a firm’s internal governance mechanism plays a vital role in controlling bribery.","","Bribery, Institutions, Auditing, Multinational firms","",""

The smuggling of excisable goods and foreign-made cars that belongs to the most tax-intensive goods is the most common. This is largely due to the unsettled activities of law enforcement agencies to identify and investigate customs offenses, the lack of reliable investigative work and an inadequate system of statistical records. Thus, the purpose of this study is to develop organizational and tactical recommendations aimed at increasing the effectiveness of their use in the process of disclosure and investigation of economic smuggling on transport, including the current achievements of the legal sciences, customs and investigation practices. The legislative acts, regulatory documents on the topic of the paper, the fundamental theoretical works of the greatest thinkers in the field under consideration, and the results of practical research by prominent Russian and foreign scientists were theoretical and methodological basis for the study","","Custom authorities, Transportation, Transaction costs","",""

We also investigate three policies that can be used to combat corruption: strengthening monitoring, increasing compensation, and enhancing accountability. Our theory suggests that increasing monitoring intensity mitigates corruption at the cost of reduced investment. The most cost- effective policy to control corruption is to enhance accountability, which reduces corruption without decreasing growth-enhancing investment. We test our theo- retical predictions using Chinese infrastructure investment and corruption data. The data show that infrastructure investment is negatively correlated with anti- corruption effort, as predicted by the theoretical model.","","Corruption, Investment incentive, Infrastructure development, China","",""
