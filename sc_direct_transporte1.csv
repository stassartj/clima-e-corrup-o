Due to the ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis however, the country's education system has been decimated at all levels, with disastrous effects for the nation's knowledge base and training provision. To address these circumstances, strategies and methods for effectively re-skilling and up-skilling the agricultural workforce inside Syria are urgently needed. Traditional face-to-face models of education are difficult to implement due to conditions of conflict. This action research project centres on the delivery of participatory e-learning courses by Syrian academics in exile to learners inside Syria. In this paper, we describe and evaluate the delivery of a 5-week pilot course on Soilless Cultivation Systems. In addition to delivering an effective course, we sought to understand the challenges associated with distance learning in the Syrian context, to inform further development of approaches that can surmount these challenges, and which might in due course be extended into other areas beyond agricultural engineering. Accordingly, we developed a course that at a) constituted a meaningful educational experience for learners; b) facilitated the trial of a range of pedagogical approaches; and c) allowed for the collection of evaluative data to inform subsequent learning design. Findings highlighted the challenges of achieving applied relevance without laboratory or field access, meeting the needs and expectations of diverse learners, and facilitating sufficient interaction between learners and the lecturer. Possible strategies to address these issues include use of high-quality video and images and planned use of routine social media technologies to facilitate parallel networking and resource share.","","e-learning, agricultural education, Syria, soilless culture systems, conflict, cross border, connected learning","",""

However, and despite its importance, the concept remains uncertain and contested. This ambiguity has led to a tendency to focus on individual challenges such as piracy or illegal fishing, rather than convergencies and synergies between and across issues, and has stymied a concerted international policy response. Debate continues over the term itself, what illicit activities it incorporates and excludes, and how these can be meaningfully conceptualised in ways that both recognise the diverse nature of the concept yet also provide a basis for an integrated response to the challenges it presents. In this paper, we address this lacuna by providing a systemic conceptualisation and analysis of transnational organised crime at sea. Our goal is to provide a firm basis for future enquiries on the different types of blue crime, to trace their distinct characteristics and identify how they intersect, and to consider what kinds of synergies can be built to respond to them. In so doing, we organise the nascent academic and policy discourse on blue criminology and maritime security to provide a new framework for navigating this complex issue for practitioners and analysts alike.","","","",""

It is, therefore, essential for multi-disciplinary risk assessment, risk mitigation, and collaborative strategies to take place among various stakeholders to mitigate this. Any strategic plan to deal with biosecurity, therefore, needs to be a complete loop, top to bottom and bottom to top. This paper describes the results of Project 62, which involved mapping and biosecurity risk assessment in South East Asia. Materials and methods The mapping and biosecurity risk assessment activities for the participating partner countries was carried out in two phases. The first phase involved risk assessment by six partner-country bio-experts for their own countries and the second phase involved conducting a joint Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) analysis and risk assessment for the South East Asian region as whole, together with international bio-experts at a workshop. Results and discussion The following key recommendations of the project show that biosecurity needs to be addressed through stakeholder engagement at multiple levels starting from the top echelons of the government to the worker who needs to recognize and understand the threats they might face: 1.Systematic analysis of existing information from BWC ISU Article 10, IHR capacities, JEE, UN Security Council Resolution 1540 Action Plan, EU CBRN NAP, and other relevant sources to develop a common understanding of the definition of biosecurity for all stakeholders in the region.2.Creation of programs for awareness building in biosecurity, not limiting them to laboratory biosecurity but using an all-inclusive approach to include border biosecurity, pandemic response, etc.3.Creation of a country-specific list of high-risk biological materials.4.Compulsory standardized biosecurity training, including responsible conduct in biosecurity research.5.Framework for one-health and security interface addressing biosecurity threats.6.Framework for ensuring information security in relation to biosecurity.7.Involvement of local/regional experts in the implementation of EU-CBRN CoE projects.","","Biosecurity, Biosafety, Biorisk, CBRN, Risk mapping, Risk assessment, Gap analysis, South East Asia","",""

The extant literature has generally considered the role of market and technical factors in dictating capacity utilization. Results, using data across more than 100 nations, show that both corruption and informal competition undermine firms' incentives to use capacity maximally. We also consider the role of infrastructure bottlenecks. Our findings showed that water supply constraints and severe electric supply restrictions limited firms’ ability to utilize capacity, but transportation limitations were not similarly binding. Further, firms' attributes, including size, age, ownership structure, and managerial experience have important bearings. An important implication is that firms’ inability to utilize capacity might be rooted in factors beyond technical constraints.","","Capacity utilization, Corruption, Informal economy, Z-inefficiency, Institutions, X-inefficiency, Infrastructure","",""

The purpose of this paper is to examine whether CSR activities in Indonesian companies support and align to the SDGs, especially in achieving the goal of responsible consumption and production. The data was collected from 453 annual reports and 44 sustainability reports of Indonesian listed companies from 2014 until 2016. The total data observation was from 585 reports. Content analysis was applied to examine the disclosures in both the annual and sustainability reports. Firstly, the analysis targeted sustainability reports. However, due to the limited number of sustainability reports, annual reports were also analyzed for the most recent year when this study was undertaken, which was 2016. The 2016 annual report content analysis shows that Indonesian companies tend to support the achievement of (1) sustainable cities and communities, (2) good health and well-being, (3) decent work and economic growth, (4) responsible consumption and production, and (5) quality education. The content analysis results for the 2014–2016 sustainability reports were found to be similar to the annual report analysis, albeit in a different order: (1) good health and well-being, (2) quality education, (3) sustainable cities and communities, (4) decent work and economic growth, and (5) responsible consumption and production. In short, based on both the annual and sustainability reports, Indonesian companies are likely to support these five SDG priorities. SDG goals are expected to be in line with the country’s commitment. However the support from the companies is not yet aligned to the SDG priorities selected in Indonesia. The results from this analysis can be used to encourage the Government to socialize and provide an understanding of SDGs and the country’s commitment to Indonesian companies. In addition, this study can be used to draw useful perspectives, not only for the Indonesian Government, but also for the other 193 countries that have adopted the SDGs. The results should encourage companies to implement business activities, in particular CSR activities that incorporate the SDG priority development targets. Also, this study can be a platform to provide a comprehensive picture to support SDGs, particularly in achieving the targets for responsible consumption and production. Other countries are expected to start examining their business activities, including CSR programs, in order to support and align with the country’s SDG targets. This evaluation is important, as the SDG initiative will soon be reaching the first one third of the 2030 target implementation timeframe, so time cannot be wasted.","","Corporate social responsibility, Indonesia, Responsible consumption and production, Sustainable development goals","",""

This finding confirms the hypothesis that in India bribery “sands the wheels” of business. A further finding is that the negative effect of bribery on productivity is stronger in states run by right leaning parties, although there is no significant effect of party orientation on the relationship between bribery and profitability. This finding supports the hypothesis that tighter connections between business and government facilitate rent seeking that undermines productivity even as profitability is unencumbered.

In this paper, we explore the interplay between traders and authorities on Congo River - a key transport corridor in one of the world’s poorest and most conflict-ridden countries; DR Congo. We outline a general theoretical framework featuring transport operators who need to pass multiple taxing stations and negotiate over taxes with several authorities on their way to a central market place. We then examine empirically the organization, extent, and factors explaining the level of taxes charged by various authorities across stations, by collecting primary data from boat operators. Most of the de facto taxes charged on Congo River have no explicit support in laws or government regulations and have been characterized as a “fend for yourself”-system of funding. Our study shows that traders have to pass more than 10 stations downstream where about 20 different authorities charge taxes. In line with hold-up theory, we find that the average level of taxation tends to increase downstream closer to Kinshasa, but authorities that were explicitly prohibited from taxing in a recent decree instead extract more payments upstream. Our results illustrate a highly dysfunctional taxing regime that nonetheless is strikingly similar to anecdotal evidence of the situation on the Rhine before 1800.

Financial analysis is used to analyze and calculate related financial values. The results reveal that the PPP adoption in this project yields different benefits and risks depending on each phase of the project. Adopting PPP can overcome key limitations and provide some real benefits that the traditional approach cannot. Simultaneously, there are risks incurred from the PPP adoption due to the complexity in PPP partnership such additional transaction costs and interrelation complexity.

This study proposes that, in the absence of corruption, firm productivity is the main determinant of being awarded government contracts. In corrupt environments, however, most productive firms are excluded from bidding, and therefore, domestic-market oriented firms are better positioned to be awarded government contracts. To test this Hypothesis, a longitudinal database is constructed from the World Bank Enterprise Survey, containing 1,898 observations across 33 developing economies. The findings corroborate our hypotheses and shows that corruption negatively moderates the relationship between firm productivity and being awarded a government contract for pro-market firms. This moderation, however, is positive for rent-seeking firms. These findings point to an important policy implication. Since excluding pro-market firms from bidding increases the cost and reduces the quality of public services, one mechanism to ensure smarter public procurement decisions is to open bidding processes to exporting firms, which our evidence suggests pay less bribes and commit less informal acts than domestic-market oriented firms.","","Government contracts, Total factor productivity, Corruption, Exporting firms, Developing countries","",""

Overall, a nationwide LCC network has been formed with each individual LCC focusing on their own markets with limited overlap to avoid cut-throat competition. Spring Airlines has developed an advanced network supported by its core bases including Shanghai in East China, Shijiazhuang in North China, Shenyang in Northeast China and Shenzhen in South China. China United has developed a network radiating from Beijing. West Air and Lucky Air seem to be developing a hub-and-spoke network that contributes to the tourism industry in West China. The LCC network is affected by seasonal variations, especially for the routes to tourism destinations such as Haikou, Sanya and Xiamen. Hub cities, however, experience less seasonal impact. This research also finds that routes between 600 and 1800 km account for a large proportion of the LCC markets. Aviation policy, local government's subsidization and the expansion of the high-speed rail network have helped shape the landscape of China's LCC sector.","","Network, Tourism destination, Seasonality, Air-route connectivity, Chinese LCC","",""

We also investigate three policies that can be used to combat corruption: strengthening monitoring, increasing compensation, and enhancing accountability. Our theory suggests that increasing monitoring intensity mitigates corruption at the cost of reduced investment. The most cost- effective policy to control corruption is to enhance accountability, which reduces corruption without decreasing growth-enhancing investment. We test our theo- retical predictions using Chinese infrastructure investment and corruption data. The data show that infrastructure investment is negatively correlated with anti- corruption effort, as predicted by the theoretical model.","","Corruption, Investment incentive, Infrastructure development, China","",""
