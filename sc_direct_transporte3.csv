A number of studies have evaluated the impacts of workplace-based interventions on the commuting behaviour of staff, but the broader potential of such initiatives depends on the willingness of employers to support them. Little research has been carried out examining the perspectives of senior managers. The research which has been conducted has focused on employers located in urban or rural areas. This paper reports on in-depth interviews with senior managers of employers located in two peri-urban areas on the edge of the city of Bristol, south-west England. The research was carried out during a period when public funding was available to support the introduction of sustainable transport measures. The interviews aimed to find out whether senior managers perceived the promotion of sustainable transport as relevant to their business concerns, and how this varied between different types of organisation. The results showed that all managers believed that measures to increase the use of alternative modes for commuting and local business travel could be beneficial for their business, even if these benefits were indirect and difficult to quantify. The perceived benefits of sustainable transport included: helping to ease traffic congestion on the road network, thereby reducing associated delays and stress; helping employers manage excessive demand for car parking; improving staff wellbeing; and widening the recruitment opportunities among workers lacking access to a private car. Employers who perceived the greatest benefits were also the most willing to engage with public authorities in introducing new workplace-based mobility measures. The findings on employer support for mobility management are relevant not only to peri-urban areas but also to employment sites within other areas (in particular suburban areas and the rural hinterland) where the same challenges may apply of encouraging alternatives to single occupancy car use without the means to invest in comprehensive public transport.","","Sustainable transport, Mobility management, Employers, Commuting, Workplace Travel Plans","",""

In addition, we also examined other relevant aspects, such as the revenue development in the national intercity bus market. Our simulations show that the introduction of distance-related road tolls in intercity bus transport (if they are completely shifted to customers in the form of surcharges) will result in significant changes: Thus, at a toll rate of 0.6 ct/passenger kilometer the modal share of intercity buses (by passenger kilometers) in the German long-distance passenger transport sector will drop by about 12 percent to 2.44 percent in the year 2025. At 0.4 ct/passenger kilometer, the share drops by almost three percent.

We investigate two alternative government's political objectives. In the first, government aims to only minimise the externality, while in the second, it also cares about the consumers surplus. We find that, in both cases, the higher the number of firms, the higher the incentive to abate.

Moreover, this has stimulated the emergence of new modes of transport, for example the motorcycle-taxi (“moto-taxi”). While moto-taxis have been used for decades in some areas, they have seen massive growth in the past couple of years and they have expanded to other rural and urban areas in SSA. This has come with a number of benefits as regards securing public mobility and socio-economic effects. On the other hand, the growth of these often “informally” provided services has resulted in negative externalities, especially road safety issues. And this has fuelled public discussions on how to control and regulate these services. Within academia their growing importance has resulted in a significant number of empirical studies – including a large share of final theses/assignments – in the past five to ten years. These studies deliver valuable insights into different aspects of this transport mode. However, only few comprehensive overviews of moto-taxis and their service characteristics exist. This article aims to present a comprehensive summary of the role played by moto-taxi services in providing public transport options in SSA. Based on an extensive literature review it categorises and summarises insights into this transport mode that are covered by the reviewed studies. The topics include underlying factors of motorcycle-taxi growth, supply side and demand side aspects, service organisation, regulation, as well as safety, health and environmental impacts. As far as available insights allow, regional, as well as urban and rural service patterns are traced. On that basis, the article discusses implications for the debate on informal transport and identifies knowledge gaps that should be addressed by future research.","","Motorcycle-taxis, Informal transport, Public transport, Research needs, Sub-Saharan Africa, Literature review","",""

This desirability is defined as a reduction in the system’s negative externalities, including accidents, congestion, pollutants and/or noise, while retaining its functionality. There is evidence that transport externalities continue to grow with an increasingly mobile and growing global population. Against this background, the article discusses what may constitute more desirable transport futures, as well as the barriers that have to be overcome to move towards such futures. The article concludes that transport governance will be essential to far-reaching change, and that greater focus has to be placed on individual and societal socio-psychological perspectives shaping mobility consumption.

Drawing on these frameworks and empirical findings, the paper identifies six governance approaches to MaaS across cases: analyser, architect, convener, experimenter, lawmaker, and provider. These basic models encompass strategies ranging from hands-on strong intervention to information collection efforts. Consistent with the transitions literature, these six approaches indicate that public transport regimes seek to control the apparent disruptive potential of MaaS by incrementally absorbing innovations; to this end, regime actors adopt governance responses that tend to reproduce existing institutionalised ways of doing and prevailing logics. Furthermore, the six approaches reveal intense interaction between regime and niche, suggesting that a niche-regime space might have emerged in the cases; actors travel and operate across niche, regime, and niche-regimes, mainly driven by concerns with market share and revenue streams in the mobility system.","","Public transport, Mobility as a Service (MaaS), Multilevel perspective (MLP), Governance theories, Meta-governance","",""

The research was conducted under the Low Carbon Transport Theme. It examines policy knowledge-seeking among transport researchers and practitioners in a subgroup of nine Sub-Saharan African and South Asian countries; these experts are already convinced of the need for HVT measures and are seeking knowledge regarding successful policy-transfer in order to accelerate transport decarbonisation. The policies in the countries investigated in this study recognise the need to reduce transport emissions, but this is rarely the measure that drives mobility interventions. Meeting the Paris Agreement targets will depend on whether low carbon, sustainable transport is rapidly and broadly implemented. Interviews with key informants include questions relating to motivations for seeking policy knowledge; the key policy knowledge that interviewees seek in order to shift country priorities or accelerate low-carbon development; and how best to share and access appropriate and relevant knowledge. These questions are drawn from the policy-transfer theory and processes described in the literature. Findings from the interviews suggest that key informants are aware of the prevalence and impact of uncritical, unsuccessful policy transfer, given their experiences with new transport measures in their countries; this is a significant lesson-learned. The value of context-specific transport policy transfer rather than off-the-shelf solutions is recognised by key informants, and appropriate policy knowledge is actively sought. A research gap exists to document an evidence-base regarding the influences and mechanisms that lead to successful low-carbon transport transfer processes in low-income countries.","","Low-income countries, Low-carbon transport, Policy transfer, Knowledge transfer, Lessons learning, Capacity development, Best practice, Sub-Saharan Africa, South-Asia","",""

The article draws on literature on consumer representation and willingness to pay, as well as data from 21 in-depth interviews. The findings suggest that within the current arrangement, passengers are dependent on airlines as their representatives, although their interests may differ concerning investments in airport infrastructure and services. This dependency is leveraged by the current airline duopoly in the Australian domestic air transport market because passengers have no transport alternatives among which to choose. Airports charging passengers their fees (and eventually negotiating prices for improved services) directly is not deemed a suitable option because it could increase the airports' market power and affect the passenger experience negatively. Recommendations, such as involving an independent representation body and diversifying service provision at the airport, are discussed as possibilities for increasing passengers’ influence.","","Australian air transport market, Consumer representation, Light-handed regulation, Willingness to pay","",""

An exploration of the intersection between the previous institutional settings and the unfolding regulatory frameworks across water, rail and road modes of freight transport suggests that the differences in each mode also influence the levers available to address issues as they arise. The economic characteristics of the road haulage sector keep the system responsive to user needs, whereas the lack of a port regulator encourages rent seeking. The rail regulator intervenes in cases of anti-competitive practice but cannot prevent an oligopolistic market structure and relies on ongoing subsidy as road haulage does not pay its full share of external costs. A distinctive British geography of governance is revealed in the different liberalisation pathway it has followed compared to continental European countries. A key conclusion is that governance analysis must include not merely the formal governance arrangements but the ability and willingness to apply suitable instruments to regulate the market to maximize economic welfare.","","Governance, Freight transport, Policy, Regulation, Privatisation, Neoliberal, Maritime, Rail, Road","",""

These are referred to as ‘uberisation’ by some and the creation of Mobility as a Service (MaaS) by others. In some cities and countries, these new services have been welcomed and even facilitated, while in others there have been clashes with regulators as well as with incumbent operators. Workshop 7 considered how these new services might be integrated into the market and whether more widespread development of ride-hailing or ride-sharing might lead to new ways of creating flexible and truly on-demand urban bus services, or alternatively would the way public transport is organized and financed ultimately be disrupted so that what is viable in terms of competition, contracts and governance would need to be reconsidered. The Workshop presented evidence and undertook discussion that could be considered under four themes: conceptual; the role of MaaS in the uncertain future, including the new digital era; the experience of flexible transport in developing countries as compared to Australia and finally, how MaaS might provide for community needs. Over and above the detail provided by the evidence in papers, the Workshop discussion identified a tension between policy formulation and operator viewpoints, the need for flexibility in developing contracts, the importance of partnership in developing MaaS packages, including bundling mobility with other services provided by government and a need to address consumer protection issues.

After an intervention by the central state County Administrative Board [länsstyrelsen], the local authority had to implement certain security measures, and also reserve an additional, large natural land area to compensate for the threats to the Natura 2000 site. Before the final decision was made, a series of negotiations occurred between the involved actors, mainly the local authority, the multinational Sonepar Group/Elektroskandia and the County Administrative Board, and the case is a fruitful target for a multifaceted analysis illuminating the tension between the goals of preserving urban biodiversity and promoting road transport and urban growth. It also offers an inside view of the negotiation and planning process. The key issue is how the siting of a potentially hazardous, transport intensive national warehouse in a city renowned for its high environmental-protection profile was possible. Considering Sweden’s high-profile regarding sustainability, the selected case also offers food for reflection on the potentials and barriers of implementing ecological modernization more generally. The lessons learned from an examination of the local authority’s attempt to harmonize such diverse policy priorities as urban biodiversity and intensive road transport for economic growth, on a site adjacent to a Natura 2000 wetlands area, may help enable urban planners and scholars to find creative policy solutions, avoid causing damage to biodiversity, and increase ecosystem values in terms of residents’ and other visitors’ experience and understanding of nature. However, at the end of the article we address the question of whether our empirical conclusion is not “too good to be true”, and raise concerns regarding the intricate relationship between sustainability and resilience; the systemic power exerted by the global Sonepar Group/Elektroskandia; and the potentials and limits of public negotiation planning.","","Multilevel governance, Negotiation planning, Narrative method, Biodiversity, Natura 2000, Road transport","",""

Further analysis reveals that, although the overall level of financial support for the public transport is very high in Switzerland, subsidies per passenger are comparatively low. It is a similar story in cities in England with very successful bus operators. Public transport in Switzerland is a public service provided mostly by companies in public ownership. Due to the lack of competitive pressure one would expect a rather moderate focus on passengers and innovations, if any at all, as well as lower levels of efficiency. The opposite is true. Based on qualitative interviews, the model developed for the explanation of this success shows that the framework conditions favour stable, intrinsic motivation on the part of management and employees in public transport. This includes the central elements of: direct democracy, decision-making and budgeting at local level, together with non-commercial, local companies directly involved in the design of the public transport system, as well as a confidence-based management culture both with respect to and within the company. The success factors of the public transport system in Innsbruck (Austria) are structurally quite similar and confirm the explanatory model.","","State ownership, Public transport, Direct award, Switzerland, Competitive tendering","",""

Theoretical considerations on optimal solutions as well as modelling of the system behavior is presented. The idea is to adapt existing pipeline construction technologies to achieve cost-effectiveness. For that reason usage of guiding/powering rails is excluded and the pipe is of circular shape. The proposed capsule dimensions are diameter of ca. 1.4 m and length of ca. 2.8 m. The exact dimensions would depend on the existing logistic chains, e.g. pallets that are used. The main findings of the article are developed dimensionless groups, computational fluid dynamics model of a capsule moving in a pipeline and an analytical model of capsule dynamics. Dimensionless groups have been verified using the model of capsule dynamics. Grid sensitivity study has been done and iterative convergence errors have been assessed for the computational fluid dynamics model. Parametric study has been conducted for a range of capsule velocities and pressure differences acting on a capsule. Results allowed describing the rate of air leaking between the capsule and pipe in an analytical form. The influence of viscous forces has been shown to be negligible in comparison to pressure forces. Developed tools allow studying various scenarios before construction of an experimental stand. It is of scientific and practical significance for any research team that would continue the study on pipeline transport systems.","","Underground freight transport, Capsule pipelines","",""

However, institutions do not always align. As a result of changes in strategy and operation, institutional incongruence can emerge as old and new institutions conflict or as actors perceive and apply institutions in a different manner. In this article, we aim to gain insight in the concept of institutional incongruence and the way it shapes transport planning policy and implementation. To this end, we analyse the role of institutional congruence in the case of land use transport integration (LUTI) in the Netherlands. Although LUTI creates opportunities for beneficial synergies and helps avoid unwanted consequences, such as project time and project cost overruns, examples of successful deployment remain scarce. Through an institutional analysis of the Dutch national Planning, Programming and Budgeting (PPB) System for road infrastructure, we assess the ways in which LUTI is enabled or obstructed by formal and informal institutions. The one-year research project involves a triangulation of literature research, policy analysis, 22 expert interviews, focus groups and workshops. The findings illustrate that strategy and operation each present distinct formal and informal institutional incongruence that negatively influence land-use transport integration. We conclude that institutional incongruence is several instances of institutional incongruence can be found throughout the Dutch national planning process. These are partly inevitable because institutional change occurs gradually to reflect developments in society and manifests itself in both formal and informal rules. Therefore we recommend that, in order to achieve LUTI, the full institutional configuration of formal and informal rules, at strategic and operational level should be analysed, redesigned and aligned.","","Land use transport integration, Institutional incongruence, PPB system, Institutional analysis","",""
